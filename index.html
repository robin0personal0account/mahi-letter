                    I heard you're not feeling well because of your period, and your tummy is hurting a lot. 😔 I'm really sorry you're going through this. Sometimes our bodies can be a bit mean, can't they? 🌸<br>
                    Make sure to rest and get lots of sleep. 🛌💤 Maybe you can curl up with a cozy blanket and watch your favorite movies. <br>
                    🎬🍿 And guess what? Eating some yummy noodles and cake might make you feel a bit better too! 🍜🍰<br>
                    If you need anything at all or just want to talk, I'm here for you! 💖 You're super strong, and this will pass soon.<br>
                    Sending you lots of love and big hugs! 💞🤗<br>
